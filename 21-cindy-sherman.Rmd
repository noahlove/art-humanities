# Cindy Sherman

American artist whose work consists primarily of photographic self-portraits, depicting herself in many different contexts and as various imagined characters. She is known as part of the "Pictures Generation."

She is both the model/ actress and the photographer/editor.

> *Untitled Film Stills* is a suite of seventy black-and-white photographs in which the artist posed in the guises of various generic female film characters, among them, ingÃ©nue, working girl, vamp, and lonely housewife. Staged to resemble scenes from 1950s and '60s Hollywood, film noir, B movies, and European art-house films, the printed images mimic in format, scale, and quality the often-staged "stills" used to promote films.

What might the mirror signify? Are we in the perspective of the mirror?

It is a performance and it highlights that. Womenhood is this larger public display she is showing. She stereotypes these different roles in her photos.

How do we rectify the differences between the two? Does it matter that they are different people.

These show a variety of roles of womanhood and femininity. Womanhood in her view seems to show that society is pushing views onto it. Society in a sense imposes on her what it means to be a women.

Her work is often linked with Feminism itself, especially as a call for attention towards the objectification of women in the media.

## Move towards color

They begin to become even more riddled, no overt and easily readable symbols. Mulvey calls Sherman an antireadable artist, as she purposely avoids easy to read ideas.

She seems unhappy or spooked.

Critics (Mulvey) says these are about the Male Gaze. The covering is related to the eroiticness. The model is created for the viewer, and the viewer in a sense shapes the narrative.

Subverting Scopophilia

Pyshcholanalytic term from Freud. An "erotic basis for pleasure in looking at another person as object... watching, in an active controlling sense, an objectified other".

Now you see this grotesque parody of feminine images. Mulvey argues that the destruction of these feelings or eroticism is a revolutionary ambition.

## Moving away from her as a model

Her images further progress away and become much more controversial and even pseudo-pornographic using mannequins and wigs. The depictions of the female body becomes incredibly revolting, possibly as a way to counter the male gaze.

Viewer discretion advised:

Sexual ambiguity can be telling. It is uncomfortable. Mulvey argues this is a "concealed decay."

> The female body's metamorphoses, in Sherman's "narrative trajectory", trace a gradual collapse of surface. (Mulvey 327)
