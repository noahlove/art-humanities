# Impressionists

There is a new unofficial salon that is replacing the traditional salon. Artists want to change the style and take risks. Everyone is mingling and many social norms are in flux.

The new salon is the "salon of the rejected" or "Salon des Refusés" in French. Literally the "exhibition of rejects." Today by extension, salon des refusés refers to any exhibition of works rejected from a juried art show.

## Claude Monet

![Impression Sunrise by Claude Monet](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Monet_-_Impression,_Sunrise.jpg "Impression Sunrise by Claude Monet")

There appear to be patches of color rather than lines. So there are not clear distinct lines between areas (like the horizon).

Usually we have lots of black and white but here we don't have really any black and almost no white (maybe a little blackish in the boat).

What we get is truly an impression. We don't get a fine detailed depiction. The critics at the salon complained that all you have is a impression, a sketch, not a painting.

In a sense, the impression is suppose to stick with you and remind you of a memory that you have. Because everything is so cloudy, you can perceive it as a wide variety of scenes.

These paintings were often really quick. Some paintings were actually done in front of the real scenes. They are the first set of artists that would actually go out and paint, rather than just in a studio. Because of that, many would paint rapidly with a lot of speed. They needed to catch the fleeting moment. There is also finally a new palette with new synthetic colors.

## Mary Cassatt

American painter and printmaker. She lived much of her adult life in France, where she first befriended Edgar Degas and later exhibited among the Impressionists.

### Mother and Child Theme

[![Mother and Child (The Oval Mirror)](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Mary%2520Cassatt%2520_%2520Mother%2520and%2520Child%2520(The%2520Oval%2520Mirror)%2520_%2520American%2520_%2520The%2520Metropolitan%2520Museum%2520of%2520Art.JPG "Mother and Child (The Oval Mirror)")](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Mary%20Cassatt%20_%20Mother%20and%20Child%20(The%20Oval%20Mirror)%20_%20American%20_%20The%20Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art.JPG)

[![Japanese Inspiration](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/variety_mary_japanese.JPG "Japanese Inspiration")](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/variety_mary_japanese.JPG)

We see children now! Often girls.

[![Little Girl in a Blue Armchair (1878)](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Cassat_-_Blue_Armchair_NGA.jpg "Little Girl in a Blue Armchair (1878)")](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Cassat_-_Blue_Armchair_NGA.jpg)

[![The Boating Party (1893/94)](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Mary_Cassatt_-_The_Boating_Party_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg "The Boating Party (1893/94)")](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Mary_Cassatt_-_The_Boating_Party_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg)

The man is incredibly dark comparatively. Also this is a time where horizon is incredibly high in the painting, similar to Japanese paintings. . There is also a beautiful parallelism in the left side with the water, sail and boat which was uncommon.

[![In the Loge (at the Opera)](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Mary_Stevenson_Cassatt_-_In_the_Loge.jpg "In the Loge (at the Opera)")](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Mary_Stevenson_Cassatt_-_In_the_Loge.jpg)

The female gaze vs the male gaze. The male gaze tries to intrude, and is looking at the female. Everyone else seems faceless, just white blobs. So much of the Opera at this time was seeing other people and being seen. It was a complex social exchange and interaction.

## Berthe Morisot

French Impressionist painter who married the brother of Édouard Manet, the painter of Olympia in the previous chapter.

[![Woman at Her Toilette](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Woman%2520at%2520her%2520Toilette%2520in%2520Detail%2520Berthe%2520Morisot.jpg "Woman at Her Toilette")](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Woman%20at%20her%20Toilette%20in%20Detail%20Berthe%20Morisot.jpg)

There is a rather subtle pallet. Lots of whites and colder tones.

[![The Cradle](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Berthe_Morisot_-_Le_Berceau.jpg "The Cradle")](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Berthe_Morisot_-_Le_Berceau.jpg)

This might be a more complex gaze then when you first look. The lady might not be as excited as we originally thought. There is no physical contact for example. Maybe she is resigned, realizing this is the future of her life. Maybe not disheveled, but not excited and possibly frustrated with the result.

[![Eugéne Manet on the Isle of Wight](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Eugene_manet_on_the_isle_of_wight.jpg "Eugéne Manet on the Isle of Wight")](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Eugene_manet_on_the_isle_of_wight.jpg)

Still somewhat muted but there feels like some nice colors. In a sense, the gender rolls might be reversed. The man is on the inside here while the women are on the outside.

### Self Portraits

[![The Cherry Tree](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/cherry-tree.jpg "The Cherry Tree")](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/cherry-tree.jpg)

## Marie Bracquemond

[![On the terrace at Sevres](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/marie_bracquemond-on_the_terrace_at_sevres_with_fantin-latour-1880-trivium-art-history.jpg "On the terrace at Sevres")](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/marie_bracquemond-on_the_terrace_at_sevres_with_fantin-latour-1880-trivium-art-history.jpg)

[![Afternoon Tea](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Braquemond_Afternoon_Tea.jpg "Afternoon Tea")](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Braquemond_Afternoon_Tea.jpg)

This artist is often grouped with the other impressionists although due to lack of support from her husband of her new style, she soon quit painting.

## Modern Sight or the **Flâneur**

Interacting with modern life by roaming through new places and sites in Paris. There is "The flâneur" which is a stroller or loafer, a usually rich and wealthy man, possibly in a top hat. Modernity is the transient, the fleeting idea and the contingent. The modern artist is being shaped by the city itself.

The city is being completely redone under Emperor Napoléon III. It is Haussmannization - the rebuilding of the core of Paris. There are new spaces, new parks and new leisure places, a new phenomenon. Finally people were out on the streets for fun.

Boulevard des Capucines by Claude Monet:

[![Boulevard des Capucines (Monet)](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Claude_Monet,_1873-74,_Boulevard_des_Capucines.jpg "Boulevard des Capucines (Monet)")](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Claude_Monet,_1873-74,_Boulevard_des_Capucines.jpg)

## Pierre-Auguste Renoir

Claude Monet Painting in His Garden at Argenteuil

[![Painting in His Garden at Argenteuil](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/painting_in_his_garden.jpg "Painting in His Garden at Argenteuil")](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/painting_in_his_garden.jpg)

To some extent, impressionism is going back to basics. It is not following the fine details of the academy. It is about expressing the modern condition. And for them realism couldn't do that.

## Charles Garnier

![Paris Opera by Charles Garnier](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Paris_Opera_full_frontal_architecture.jpg "Paris Opera by Charles Garnier")

The opera house, also known as Palais Garnier or Opéra Garnier. Previous palaces, with their level of opulence, were to point out the palace as the peak of everything. It had to be proportionate to the power of the king. This was built for the Paris Opera from 1861 to 1875 at the behest of Emperor Napoleon III.

## Edgar Degas

![The Dance Class - Degas](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/degas-the-dance-class.jpg "The Dance Class - Degas")

From the MET:

> This work and its variant in the Musée d'Orsay, Paris, represent the most ambitious paintings Degas devoted to the theme of the dance. Some twenty-four women, ballerinas and their mothers, wait while a dancer executes an "attitude" for her examination. Jules Perrot, a famous ballet master, conducts the class. The imaginary scene is set in a rehearsal room in the old Paris Opéra, which had recently burned to the ground. On the wall beside the mirror, a poster for Rossini's *Guillaume Tell* pays tribute to the singer Jean-Baptiste Faure, who commissioned the picture and lent it to the 1876 Impressionist exhibition.

There is almost no subject when you first look. It is confusing and a lot going on. The distribution of figures is confusing.

## Claude Monet

![Women in the Garden - Claude Monet](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Claude_Monet_women_in_the_garden.jpg "Women in the Garden - Claude Monet")

Women in the Garden - Claude Monet

Just a moment in a garden - that is not good enough for the academy. No values supported.

Not Monet, but his teacher who had a women in a garden painting accepted:

### Change of studio

Artists are again outside now! Monet even liked

![Claude Monet Painting in his Studio](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Monet_Painting_on_His_Studio_Boat_Edouard_Manet_1874.jpg "Claude Monet Painting in his Studio")

There is also a lot of water as such: On the Bank of the Seine by Claude Monet

![On the Bank of the Seine by Claude Monet](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/On_the_Bank_of_the_Seine.jpg "On the Bank of the Seine by Claude Monet")

![La Grenouillere by Claude Monet](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/La_Grenouillere_MET_monet.jpg "La Grenouillere by Claude Monet")

La Grenouillère by Claude Monet

Where are your eyes drawn? It almost seems like it is up. However, it is difficult to find the rules. There is not an obvious vanishing points with lines drawn to it. Maybe the eye is drawn to the flattening surface of the water as it goes higher.

![La Grenouillere by Auguste Renoir](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/La_Grenouillere_Auguste_Renoir.jpg "La Grenouillere by Auguste Renoir")

La Grenouillère by Auguste Renoir.

There are a variety of techniques here, specifically the water is really beautiful to the eye. The reflection and choppy surface makes a really interesting appearance.

### Series

[![The Four Trees, (Four Poplars on the Banks of the Epte River near Giverny) by Claude Monet](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/1891_Monet_The_four_trees_anagoria.jfif "The Four Trees, (Four Poplars on the Banks of the Epte River near Giverny) Claude Monet")](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/1891_Monet_The_four_trees_anagoria.jfif)

Monet movies to doing series, a bunch of paintings of a very similar or same subject. Slowly but surely the humans are completely removed.

[![Haystack series by Monet](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/haystack_series_monet.JPG "Haystack series by Monet")](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/haystack_series_monet.JPG)

[![Cathedral Series by Monet](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/monet_cathedral_series.JPG "Cathedral Series by Monet")](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/monet_cathedral_series.JPG)

### Water Lillies

For a large part of his later career, he buys an estate with a pond and produces a massive amount of water lilly paintings. You can see a progression in them:

[![Water Lillies and Japanese Bridge (Claude Monet)](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Claude_Monet_Water_Lilies_and_Japanese_Bridge.jpg "Water Lillies and Japanese Bridge (Claude Monet)")](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Claude_Monet_Water_Lilies_and_Japanese_Bridge.jpg)

He moves to a three part picture basis towards the end:

[![Reflections of Clouds on the Water Lily Pond (Claude Monet)](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/WLA_moma_Monet_Reflections_of_Clouds_on_the_Water-Lily_Pond.jpg "Reflections of Clouds on the Water Lily Pond (Claude Monet)")](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/WLA_moma_Monet_Reflections_of_Clouds_on_the_Water-Lily_Pond.jpg)

Monet through his career had such a progressive approach and slowly changed the entire way of impressionist paintings.
