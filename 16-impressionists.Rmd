# Impressionists

There is a new unofficial salon that is replacing the traditional salon. Artists want to change the style and take risks. Everyone is mingling and many social norms are in flux.

The new salon is the "salon of the rejected" or "Salon des Refusés" in French. Literally the "exhibition of rejects." Today by extension, salon des refusés refers to any exhibition of works rejected from a juried art show.

## Claude Monet

There appear to be patches of color rather than lines. So there are not clear distinct lines between areas (like the horizon).

Usually we have lots of black and white but here we don't have really any black and almost no white (maybe a little blackish in the boat).

What we get is truly an impression. We don't get a fine detailed depiction. The critics at the salon complained that all you have is a impression, a sketch, not a painting.

In a sense, the impression is suppose to stick with you and remind you of a memory that you have. Because everything is so cloudy, you can perceive it as a wide variety of scenes.

These paintings were often really quick. Some paintings were actually done in front of the real scenes. They are the first set of artists that would actually go out and paint, rather than just in a studio. Because of that, many would paint rapidly with a lot of speed. They needed to catch the fleeting moment. There is also finally a new palette with new synthetic colors.

## Mary Cassatt

American painter and printmaker. She lived much of her adult life in France, where she first befriended Edgar Degas and later exhibited among the Impressionists.
