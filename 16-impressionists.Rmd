# Impressionists

There is a new unofficial salon that is replacing the traditional salon. Artists want to change the style and take risks. Everyone is mingling and many social norms are in flux.

The new salon is the "salon of the rejected" or "Salon des Refusés" in French. Literally the "exhibition of rejects." Today by extension, salon des refusés refers to any exhibition of works rejected from a juried art show.

## Claude Monet

There appear to be patches of color rather than lines. So there are not clear distinct lines between areas (like the horizon).

Usually we have lots of black and white but here we don't have really any black and almost no white (maybe a little blackish in the boat).

What we get is truly an impression. We don't get a fine detailed depiction. The critics at the salon complained that all you have is a impression, a sketch, not a painting.

In a sense, the impression is suppose to stick with you and remind you of a memory that you have. Because everything is so cloudy, you can perceive it as a wide variety of scenes.

These paintings were often really quick. Some paintings were actually done in front of the real scenes. They are the first set of artists that would actually go out and paint, rather than just in a studio. Because of that, many would paint rapidly with a lot of speed. They needed to catch the fleeting moment. There is also finally a new palette with new synthetic colors.

## Mary Cassatt

American painter and printmaker. She lived much of her adult life in France, where she first befriended Edgar Degas and later exhibited among the Impressionists.

### Mother and Child Theme

[![Japanese Inspiration](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/variety_mary_japanese.JPG "Japanese Inspiration")](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/variety_mary_japanese.JPG)

We see children now! Often girls.

The man is incredibly dark comparatively. Also this is a time where horizon is incredibly high in the painting, similar to Japanese paintings. . There is also a beautiful parallelism in the left side with the water, sail and boat which was uncommon.

[![In the Loge (at the Opera)](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Mary_Stevenson_Cassatt_-_In_the_Loge.jpg "In the Loge (at the Opera)")](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Mary_Stevenson_Cassatt_-_In_the_Loge.jpg)

The female gaze vs the male gaze. The male gaze tries to intrude, and is looking at the female. Everyone else seems faceless, just white blobs. So much of the Opera at this time was seeing other people and being seen. It was a complex social exchange and interaction.

## Berthe Morisot

French Impressionist painter who married the brother of Édouard Manet, the painter of Olympia in the previous chapter.

[![Woman at Her Toilette](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Woman%2520at%2520her%2520Toilette%2520in%2520Detail%2520Berthe%2520Morisot.jpg "Woman at Her Toilette")](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Woman%20at%20her%20Toilette%20in%20Detail%20Berthe%20Morisot.jpg)

There is a rather subtle pallet. Lots of whites and colder tones.

[![The Cradle](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Berthe_Morisot_-_Le_Berceau.jpg "The Cradle")](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Berthe_Morisot_-_Le_Berceau.jpg)

This might be a more complex gaze then when you first look. The lady might not be as excited as we originally thought. There is no physical contact for example. Maybe she is resigned, realizing this is the future of her life. Maybe not disheveled, but not excited and possibly frustrated with the result.

[![Eugéne Manet on the Isle of Wight](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Eugene_manet_on_the_isle_of_wight.jpg "Eugéne Manet on the Isle of Wight")](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Eugene_manet_on_the_isle_of_wight.jpg)

Still somewhat muted but there feels like some nice colors. In a sense, the gender rolls might be reversed. The man is on the inside here while the women are on the outside.

## Marie Bracquemond

[![Afternoon Tea](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Braquemond_Afternoon_Tea.jpg "Afternoon Tea")](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Braquemond_Afternoon_Tea.jpg)

This artist is often grouped with the other impressionists although due to lack of support from her husband of her new style, she soon quit painting.

## Modern Sight or the **Flâneur**

Interacting with modern life by roaming through new places and sites in Paris. There is "The flâneur" which is a stroller or loafer, a usually rich and wealthy man, possibly in a top hat. Modernity is the transient, the fleeting idea and the contingent. The modern artist is being shaped by the city itself.

The city is being completely redone under Emperor Napoléon III. It is Haussmannization - the rebuilding of the core of Paris. There are new spaces, new parks and new leisure places, a new phenomenon. Finally people were out on the streets for fun.

Boulevard des Capucines by Claude Monet:

## Pierre-Auguste Renoir

Claude Monet Painting in His Garden at Argenteuil

[![Painting in His Garden at Argenteuil](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/painting_in_his_garden.jpg "Painting in His Garden at Argenteuil")](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/painting_in_his_garden.jpg)

To some extent, impressionism is going back to basics. It is not following the fine details of the academy. It is about expressing the modern condition. And for them realism couldn't do that.
