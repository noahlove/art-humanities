# Basquiat and Warhol

## Jean-Michel Basquiat

American artist who rose to success during the 1980s. Regarded as one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, he was part of the Neo-expressionism movement.

He achieved fame as "SAMO", a graffiti duo who did epigrams in the Lower East Side in the late 70's. He died at 27 in 1988. His work sold in May 2017, called Untitled, for \$110.5 million, becoming the record high for an American artist.

His painting style was self described as child like, both in the way he held the brush but also his outcomes often. However, his artwork is not void of historical references and advanced ideas.

Rembrandt had massive hands in his self portrait and it seems Basquiat was writing himself in with the other great portraitures.

Maybe this is how he feels seen. There is a sense of crude simplicity.

Where is he? Maybe the city? Black, white and grid like.

### Relation to Picasso

Picasso served as a large inspiration to him. Guernica had a large influence on him.

## Andy Warhol Collaboration

# Andy Warhol

American artist, film director, and producer who was a leading figure in the pop art movement. Basquiat and Warhol were super close actually! They had a mutual admiration.

## Collabs with Basquiat

![Arm and Hmmaer](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Arm_and_hammer_Basquiat_Warhol.jpg "Arm and Hammer")

Warhol paintinged the base, the identical arm and hammer logos, and then sent it to Basquiat to add on his version. Charlie Parker is being presented by Basquiat on the left.

Warhol of course has his basic characteristic employment of corporate logos and advertising. Basquiat then "defaces" it with his freehand style.

Big criticism was that these pictures feel completely like Basquiat. It is hard to say they feel extremely like Warhol.
