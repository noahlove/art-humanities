It is not a historical survey, but an analytical study of a limited number of monuments and artists, and teaches students how to look at, think about, and engage in critical discussion of the visual arts. Classes are limited to 22 students; they are discussion-based and make extensive use of New York City through field trips to museums, buildings, and monuments. For more information: click here This class was taught by Martina Mims. She is a Part-time Core Lecturer for Art Humanities at Columbia and recieved her Ph.D. at Columbia in Architecture in 2013.

A new interpretation of the Greek Parthenon. This class is called the masterpieces of western art. So it must start somewhere and that somewhere is typically Greece. After hundreds of years of a dominating interpretation, this provides a new theme and feel of the Greeks. A few key facts for context. 2.1.1 Map It is surrounded by sea and has an incredible visibility. It is a token of visibility for many including visitors. This class is based on a training of visual analysis. We want to be able to see something and think critically about it. Background knowledge shouldn’t be critical to our understanding of the building or art piece. How is it constructed? What is the experience you would have experienced walking up? What type of experience does the Parthenon provide, to you as an Athenian citizen or a visiting sailor. Why are there big columns? Why do they encircle the building? We have similar supports in ancient Egypt, but never enclosing a building. Maybe in front, maybe inside a temple, but not on the outside. The inside of the temple would typically house a stature of a Greek god. This temple would be dedicated to the deity of Athens: Athena. 2.2 Analysis of the Parthenon: What can we derive from the architecture? - Transparency: a new religious experience - Simplicity: uniformity, regularity, orderly, and repetition. - Porosity: it is a different building when you get further away - Clean - Post and lentil structural system. They didn’t know how to build curved things. They build will tall columns. What they support was also relatively short in span. So they support with equal distancing. They are literally showing how the building is standing up. They carefully show us how the building and the structure work. The “capital” or the transitional part from the column to the above support, is unique. It has an almost mushroom like end of the column, and then a panel between that and the superstructure. It gives a feeling of something being squashed under the weight of being pushed down. The columns actually taper on the way up, which is rather surprising. They are not monoliths, but drums with multiple pieces. Many argue that the Greeks show how the opposing forces work. You see the squishing effect, and you see the opposing forces. You see the balance between the two. So what were the opposing forces for the Greeks? Possibly democracy? A bunch of individual pillars that support a larger whole. Athenians were very religious and almost arrogant about their “closeness” to the gods. The Athenians are beginning to assert some sort of agency and humanism. They finally put this somewhat to the forefront. And a major question is how does one balance these: individual agency and the gods. 2.2.0.0.1 RECAP from last class: Athenian temple, the Parthenon is located in the city-state Athens. Around 440BCE when this temple is built. Built by Iktinos and Kallikrates. This temple is built entirely in very high-quality marble. The material is always an important topic. It does not come from too far away, but it is a very large temple. The precision in which the stones are put together is incredible, literally a width of a hair. It is a very expensive material, and marble is a unique choice of stone compared to something like limestone. The size of this marble temple is truly different from other temples at the time. There is a level of transparency and porosity to this building. The Greeks were the first to envelope the temple with pillars like this. Simplicity and order are noticeable. 2.3 Elements 2.3.0.1 Marble a symbol of Athenian identity. There is an incredible permanence to marble, but also luxury. For the Greeks, this was literally the home of Athena. They built out of marble with a sense of longitude and legacy. 2.3.0.2 Location Location: The Parthenon is located on a rather central Acropolis. But it can be seen everywhere. Even ships from the sea were able to view the Parthenon. 2.3.0.3 City-states The city states were often in war with each other, but also there were the Persians that would attack from the East. In a sense, you feel from everywhere that Athena is protecting you. To visitors, this is an example of Imperial might and shows their incredible power. 2.3.0.4 Delian League Delian league: the city states are fighting, but they know the Persians might come from the East. Eventually they have to decide to fight the Persians together. Athens was the center of this league. And in some sense, there is a belief that the Delian league helped fund the entire acropolis, especially the Parthenon. 2.3.0.5 Remakes Remakes: Why would the United States choose to build something in resemblance of the Parthenon. Many may think of the Parthenon as the “birth structure” of the western culture. Can you derive the values from the building? Many call backs to Greeks for points of political or cultural references and a foundation for our own politics and culture. 2.3.0.6 Simplicity Simplicity: Even Stonehenge was simple and primal like this. Columns that support other platforms. But it shows how things work: it shows how the building truly functions and shows the functions of the building. It really shows how the physics of the building work and the pushing of the building. 2.3.0.7 Sculptures Sculptures: There are incredible statues built all around the temple that many people would have never seen but are still intricate and beautiful. 2.3.0.8 Paint Paint: There might have been quite a bit of color on the temple. There was “polychromy”, not the pristine white marble that we originally imagined. White marble was established in the 18th century and was very consistent since. It resembled the “ideal of noble simplicity and quit grandeur”. In a sense, the white marble is really more of our tradition rather than the Greek’s. 2.3.0.9 The entrance Entrance? It is unclear whether anyone could enter the temple. There were massive stairs that no one can climb. Only little stairs at the entrance that humans would be able to use. The Structural system of post and lintel is again very critical. They want you to see how this is working. They however had to follow the previously found tradition. For example the Doric order. It was almost a very specific set of instructions. 2.3.0.10 The Frieze Frieze: the part of the building that is decorated. For Doric: you need to follow alternative triglyph and metope. Triglyph would have vertical lines and the metope would have a sculpture carved into it. The Doric structure doesn’t have a base (gradual transition) into the column. Instead at the top it has a capital, a transition at the top. So the question would be why Doric rather than Ionic? Which looks sturdier? Well Doric looks really strong, almost like part of the building. The Ionic is more decorative and feels slightly more intellectual. Big libraries for example, you will see Ionic, but federal and government buildings will often have Doric order columns. The columns are also “fluted” , they have vertical lines running vertically along the surface of the columns. There is also ionic parts on the inside: Possibly four ionic columns and an interior ionic frieze. The nuances give life to the temple. Without the nuances, the temple would feel rather bland and boring. 2.3.0.11 Odd spacing Odd spacing: The entire platform is curved! The columns aren’t equally spaced. Many of these were from Doric proportions. We know the bulging of the columns was very purposeful. They had very strict formulas but didn’t use them. The entire building’s structural elements are made from curves. Athena as a treasury: Parts of her statue were detachable and pure gold and could be used as currency when needed such as during wars or times of trouble. Final statue: Doryphoros. The Greeks had their statues more fluid. The Egyptions had static, rigid with symmetry. The Greeks changed and were ready to move. To relax, you shift the hips, relax the opposing arm and tense the opposite leg. You have a criss cross of opposing forces. There is a balance of opposing forces. They are nude to have an idealized, physical body to bring them close to gods. 2.4 Where does the Frieze belong How does the display of something effect our interpretation: We are missing the context. The new Acropolis Museum tries to superposition them in front of the Parthenon in the background Do we care about bringing them to their birth place, or is anywhere fine? So why does Britain thing they are entitled to them? "],["grants-tomb-journal-entry.html", "Chapter 3 Grant’s Tomb (Journal Entry) 3.1 The Columns 3.2 The pediment resembling statues 3.3 The Eagles? 3.4 The Dome", " Chapter 3 Grant’s Tomb (Journal Entry) grants_old &lt;- &quot;https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/GrantsTomb.jpg&quot; Old depiction of the tomb My first thought when viewing Grant’s memorial is a sense of power and strength. In a sense, it almost feels like a fortress that the general is defending 3.1 The Columns To begin, there are noticeable columns through the building. There are two layers of columns and an additional set of statues above both which look like columns from afar, although they are more decorative (they are eagles but actually look like axes from a medium distance). The bottom columns remind me of the Egyptian architecture that the Parthenon strayed away from in surrounding the building. They are at the front, and closely resemble many of the features that we talked about in the Parthenon. They taper on the way up, and have a connecting piece (the capital) somewhat similar to the Parthenon, although more box like. However, many of the features that we discussed about the columns and their effects are absent from the Sculpture. Noticeably, the columns do not give a sense of porosity and openness. They do feel weight bearing but not nearly as welcoming as someone had mentioned in class. The structure doesn’t have the same post and lentil feel. It feels like a solid four-walled fortress with columns in the front and around the top dome for decoration. Maybe to support the sort-of balcony if anything. 3.2 The pediment resembling statues Of quick mention is the somewhat of a pediment that feels very triangular like that of the Parthenon. Although it is much further simplified (as does the rest of the sculpting feel on this tomb). Also noticable is the use of words rather than just sculptures. ”LET US HAVE PEACE” is at the center, and seems to draw the eye as the center of the sculpture. Unlike the Parthenon, the pediment doesn’t seem to add to the grandness of the statue. It seems to make a simple statement about the wishes of those that lay within. grants_modern &lt;- &quot;https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/grants_tomb_modern.JPG&quot; Modern Day picture of the tomb 3.3 The Eagles? The almost dragon-like eagles quickly drew my attention. Of the animals present on the Parthenon, I do not recall any bird. After quick research, it turns out the eagles are a relatively new decoration, (donated by the New York City Post Office in the 30’s); this explains why they are not seen in the post card image above but are shown below in a modern photo. The eagles however don’t feel like a sign of democracy or a welcoming entrance to a war hero of the country. They feel imposing, almost like they stand guard to the entrance of the fallen general and his wife. 3.4 The Dome In some sense, the tomb feels like it has a Parthenon/Egyptian inspiration on bottom with the capital dome put on top. The capital dome having been completed just 31 years prior, I don’t think it is a stretch to believe it was the inspiration for the classical column surrounded dome on top. Noteably, it provides some of the openness that the Parthenon provided through its use of encompassing columns. Two pieces naturally belong together. The bottom fortress and top resemblance of democracy I think must be purposeful. It shows a joining of politics and war, a uniting of the country through a man who served both as a leading general and as president of it. It shows both sides of the fallen president and is all set in marble, a material of permanence as we discussed in class. "],["rembrandt.html", "Chapter 4 Rembrandt 4.1 Portraits, especially self-portraits", " Chapter 4 Rembrandt 4.1 Portraits, especially self-portraits This is a a typical portrait of the day (done by Rembrandt with husband and wife side by side. ) The background is more contrasting. It is in your face and bold and black. This portraits seems almost nervous and timid. There is a pyschological air to this. How does the author see themselves. The background is interestingly lit up as well. It seems youthful. This background is somewhat new to us. Rather rough and somewhat abstract. His hair seems quite course. It seems almost tactile. The hair almost feels like we can touch it. The presence is very different in the picture. He used the back of the brush which is very interesting. How is paint used to render hair between the two? Rembrandt’s hair feels more real. Durer relies more heavily on the different colores for contrast. Rembrandts feel more like laying and the form. 4.1.0.1 Older Portrait old_rem_url &lt;- &quot;https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/rembrandt-older-portrait.jpg&quot; Older Self Portrait This one is much later, at 1660. He was more experienced by now. The contemporaries didn’t love the loose brush stroke that he was known for. Most people wanted realistic close brush strokes. They would say his works are unfinished, more like a sketch. There is so much skin texture. It is more wrinkly and smooth at the same time. There is quite a lot of detail while also being super unrealistic. At a close level, it doesn’t look normal, but it looks almost how it feels. It almost look leathery. It is somewhat, what it feels like. It also makes him less contoured, he begins to blend into the back ground. Imagine this hanging back in the 1600’s, with just a little bit of candlelight and not the spotlights that we have today. 4.1.0.1.1 The coat: The coat is really interesting. The splashes of various colors, reds and greens is very interesting. Not the fur coat that we saw earlier. Much longer strokes. The paint behaves almost like it has tension. Because the brush went in all different directions, it feels almost on the body. The coat feels worn and old, maybe slightly faded. It is ironically shown with more colors. You can see the seems in the shoulders, and it is almost falling apart. 4.1.0.1.2 Is this a self-portrait the_artist_in &lt;- &quot;https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Rembrandt_The_Artist_in_his_studio.jpg&quot; Rembrandt, The Artist in his studio The room is really worn. Around it, there are items for painting. A palette, and materials to mix his paint. Maybe the question is what is art to Rembrandt. All the tools are in the room, but the viewer has to imagine what is on the painting. All you truly need is your imagination. 4.1.0.2 Similar presentation of a man with a golden helmet man_helmet &lt;- &quot;https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Rembrandt_The_Man_with_the_Golden_Helmet.jpg&quot; Rembrandt, The Man with the Golden Helmet (ca. 1650) There is a such a feeling of life here. He sits here, and you can almost feel the weight of all he has been through. All of Rembrandt’s pictures portraits sort of look like they need a hug. Definitely not the most cheerful. "]]
