It is not a historical survey, but an analytical study of a limited number of monuments and artists, and teaches students how to look at, think about, and engage in critical discussion of the visual arts. Classes are limited to 22 students; they are discussion-based and make extensive use of New York City through field trips to museums, buildings, and monuments. For more information: click here This class was taught by Martina Mims. She is a Part-time Core Lecturer for Art Humanities at Columbia and recieved her Ph.D. at Columbia in Architecture in 2013.

A new interpretation of the Greek Parthenon. This class is called the masterpieces of western art. So it must start somewhere and that somewhere is typically Greece. After hundreds of years of a dominating interpretation, this provides a new theme and feel of the Greeks. A few key facts for context. 2.1.1 Map It is surrounded by sea and has an incredible visibility. It is a token of visibility for many including visitors. This class is based on a training of visual analysis. We want to be able to see something and think critically about it. Background knowledge shouldn’t be critical to our understanding of the building or art piece. How is it constructed? What is the experience you would have experienced walking up? What type of experience does the Parthenon provide, to you as an Athenian citizen or a visiting sailor. Why are there big columns? Why do they encircle the building? We have similar supports in ancient Egypt, but never enclosing a building. Maybe in front, maybe inside a temple, but not on the outside. The inside of the temple would typically house a stature of a Greek god. This temple would be dedicated to the deity of Athens: Athena. 2.2 Analysis of the Parthenon: What can we derive from the architecture? - Transparency: a new religious experience - Simplicity: uniformity, regularity, orderly, and repetition. - Porosity: it is a different building when you get further away - Clean - Post and lentil structural system. They didn’t know how to build curved things. They build will tall columns. What they support was also relatively short in span. So they support with equal distancing. They are literally showing how the building is standing up. They carefully show us how the building and the structure work. The “capital” or the transitional part from the column to the above support, is unique. It has an almost mushroom like end of the column, and then a panel between that and the superstructure. It gives a feeling of something being squashed under the weight of being pushed down. The columns actually taper on the way up, which is rather surprising. They are not monoliths, but drums with multiple pieces. Many argue that the Greeks show how the opposing forces work. You see the squishing effect, and you see the opposing forces. You see the balance between the two. So what were the opposing forces for the Greeks? Possibly democracy? A bunch of individual pillars that support a larger whole. Athenians were very religious and almost arrogant about their “closeness” to the gods. The Athenians are beginning to assert some sort of agency and humanism. They finally put this somewhat to the forefront. And a major question is how does one balance these: individual agency and the gods. 2.2.0.0.1 RECAP from last class: Athenian temple, the Parthenon is located in the city-state Athens. Around 440BCE when this temple is built. Built by Iktinos and Kallikrates. This temple is built entirely in very high-quality marble. The material is always an important topic. It does not come from too far away, but it is a very large temple. The precision in which the stones are put together is incredible, literally a width of a hair. It is a very expensive material, and marble is a unique choice of stone compared to something like limestone. The size of this marble temple is truly different from other temples at the time. There is a level of transparency and porosity to this building. The Greeks were the first to envelope the temple with pillars like this. Simplicity and order are noticeable. 2.3 Elements 2.3.0.1 Marble a symbol of Athenian identity. There is an incredible permanence to marble, but also luxury. For the Greeks, this was literally the home of Athena. They built out of marble with a sense of longitude and legacy. 2.3.0.2 Location Location: The Parthenon is located on a rather central Acropolis. But it can be seen everywhere. Even ships from the sea were able to view the Parthenon. 2.3.0.3 City-states The city states were often in war with each other, but also there were the Persians that would attack from the East. In a sense, you feel from everywhere that Athena is protecting you. To visitors, this is an example of Imperial might and shows their incredible power. 2.3.0.4 Delian League Delian league: the city states are fighting, but they know the Persians might come from the East. Eventually they have to decide to fight the Persians together. Athens was the center of this league. And in some sense, there is a belief that the Delian league helped fund the entire acropolis, especially the Parthenon. 2.3.0.5 Remakes Remakes: Why would the United States choose to build something in resemblance of the Parthenon. Many may think of the Parthenon as the “birth structure” of the western culture. Can you derive the values from the building? Many call backs to Greeks for points of political or cultural references and a foundation for our own politics and culture. 2.3.0.6 Simplicity Simplicity: Even Stonehenge was simple and primal like this. Columns that support other platforms. But it shows how things work: it shows how the building truly functions and shows the functions of the building. It really shows how the physics of the building work and the pushing of the building. 2.3.0.7 Sculptures Sculptures: There are incredible statues built all around the temple that many people would have never seen but are still intricate and beautiful. 2.3.0.8 Paint Paint: There might have been quite a bit of color on the temple. There was “polychromy”, not the pristine white marble that we originally imagined. White marble was established in the 18th century and was very consistent since. It resembled the “ideal of noble simplicity and quit grandeur”. In a sense, the white marble is really more of our tradition rather than the Greek’s. 2.3.0.9 The entrance Entrance? It is unclear whether anyone could enter the temple. There were massive stairs that no one can climb. Only little stairs at the entrance that humans would be able to use. The Structural system of post and lintel is again very critical. They want you to see how this is working. They however had to follow the previously found tradition. For example the Doric order. It was almost a very specific set of instructions. 2.3.0.10 The Frieze Frieze: the part of the building that is decorated. For Doric: you need to follow alternative triglyph and metope. Triglyph would have vertical lines and the metope would have a sculpture carved into it. The Doric structure doesn’t have a base (gradual transition) into the column. Instead at the top it has a capital, a transition at the top. So the question would be why Doric rather than Ionic? Which looks sturdier? Well Doric looks really strong, almost like part of the building. The Ionic is more decorative and feels slightly more intellectual. Big libraries for example, you will see Ionic, but federal and government buildings will often have Doric order columns. The columns are also “fluted” , they have vertical lines running vertically along the surface of the columns. There is also ionic parts on the inside: Possibly four ionic columns and an interior ionic frieze. The nuances give life to the temple. Without the nuances, the temple would feel rather bland and boring. 2.3.0.11 Odd spacing Odd spacing: The entire platform is curved! The columns aren’t equally spaced. Many of these were from Doric proportions. We know the bulging of the columns was very purposeful. They had very strict formulas but didn’t use them. The entire building’s structural elements are made from curves. Athena as a treasury: Parts of her statue were detachable and pure gold and could be used as currency when needed such as during wars or times of trouble. Final statue: Doryphoros. The Greeks had their statues more fluid. The Egyptions had static, rigid with symmetry. The Greeks changed and were ready to move. To relax, you shift the hips, relax the opposing arm and tense the opposite leg. You have a criss cross of opposing forces. There is a balance of opposing forces. They are nude to have an idealized, physical body to bring them close to gods. 2.4 Where does the Frieze belong How does the display of something effect our interpretation: We are missing the context. The new Acropolis Museum tries to superposition them in front of the Parthenon in the background Do we care about bringing them to their birth place, or is anywhere fine? So why does Britain thing they are entitled to them? "],["grants-tomb-journal-entry.html", "Chapter 3 Grant’s Tomb (Journal Entry) 3.1 The Columns 3.2 The pediment resembling statues 3.3 The Eagles? 3.4 The Dome", " Chapter 3 Grant’s Tomb (Journal Entry) grants_old &lt;- &quot;https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/GrantsTomb.jpg&quot; Old depiction of the tomb My first thought when viewing Grant’s memorial is a sense of power and strength. In a sense, it almost feels like a fortress that the general is defending 3.1 The Columns To begin, there are noticeable columns through the building. There are two layers of columns and an additional set of statues above both which look like columns from afar, although they are more decorative (they are eagles but actually look like axes from a medium distance). The bottom columns remind me of the Egyptian architecture that the Parthenon strayed away from in surrounding the building. They are at the front, and closely resemble many of the features that we talked about in the Parthenon. They taper on the way up, and have a connecting piece (the capital) somewhat similar to the Parthenon, although more box like. However, many of the features that we discussed about the columns and their effects are absent from the Sculpture. Noticeably, the columns do not give a sense of porosity and openness. They do feel weight bearing but not nearly as welcoming as someone had mentioned in class. The structure doesn’t have the same post and lentil feel. It feels like a solid four-walled fortress with columns in the front and around the top dome for decoration. Maybe to support the sort-of balcony if anything. 3.2 The pediment resembling statues Of quick mention is the somewhat of a pediment that feels very triangular like that of the Parthenon. Although it is much further simplified (as does the rest of the sculpting feel on this tomb). Also noticable is the use of words rather than just sculptures. ”LET US HAVE PEACE” is at the center, and seems to draw the eye as the center of the sculpture. Unlike the Parthenon, the pediment doesn’t seem to add to the grandness of the statue. It seems to make a simple statement about the wishes of those that lay within. grants_modern &lt;- &quot;https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/grants_tomb_modern.JPG&quot; Modern Day picture of the tomb 3.3 The Eagles? The almost dragon-like eagles quickly drew my attention. Of the animals present on the Parthenon, I do not recall any bird. After quick research, it turns out the eagles are a relatively new decoration, (donated by the New York City Post Office in the 30’s); this explains why they are not seen in the post card image above but are shown below in a modern photo. The eagles however don’t feel like a sign of democracy or a welcoming entrance to a war hero of the country. They feel imposing, almost like they stand guard to the entrance of the fallen general and his wife. 3.4 The Dome In some sense, the tomb feels like it has a Parthenon/Egyptian inspiration on bottom with the capital dome put on top. The capital dome having been completed just 31 years prior, I don’t think it is a stretch to believe it was the inspiration for the classical column surrounded dome on top. Noteably, it provides some of the openness that the Parthenon provided through its use of encompassing columns. Two pieces naturally belong together. The bottom fortress and top resemblance of democracy I think must be purposeful. It shows a joining of politics and war, a uniting of the country through a man who served both as a leading general and as president of it. It shows both sides of the fallen president and is all set in marble, a material of permanence as we discussed in class. "],["emiens-gothic.html", "Chapter 4 Emiens Gothic 4.1 Architectural Plan", " Chapter 4 Emiens Gothic 4.1 Architectural Plan url &lt;- &quot;https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/amiens_gothic_layout.jpg&quot; The bold represents the structurally necessary parts. Circles around the bottom of poles represent a base. No circle are Doric and the circle have a base (Ionic or Corinthian). The ends that were semi-circles were for high level clergy. There are a lot of 7 in the temple. Similar to the ratio that was used in the Parthenon. The building was converted. This was a roman basilica (meeting hall). So what are the bold, structural parts. It seems like the outside is providing most of the structural support. There are no solid walls! They used the buttresses so they could use glass in between. There are not solid walls almost anywhere. url &lt;- &quot;https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/amiens_cathedral_vocab.jpg&quot; So why no walls? The buildings massiveness go away and everything that is left flickers in the daylight and almost dematerializes. Partially neo-roman and partially neo-gothic. This is a relatively new cathedraral. There were already skyscrapers. So how does it have a feeling of authenticity and still feel new and innovative. Roman-esqe were before the gothic style. Lower, not with the knowledge of building as high. Looking at the north of Paris, we see amees. We will look at Notre Dame, or our lady. Once the technology comes out, it is almost an arms race to have the best temple/cathedraral. You attracted pilgrames and money from the area. It literally became a competition. Looking at the western fassad, and proceeding towards the alter, we are proceeding towards the east. Rising sun, resurrection and related symbology towards the direction. url &lt;- &quot;https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/west_facade_amiens.png&quot; url &lt;- &quot;https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/church_diagram.jpg&quot; Boroque is the same thing. A pajortive way to say out of shape pearl. Then neo-classicism. There is a constant struggle between moving forward and looking back. url &lt;- &quot;https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/church_locations.jpg&quot; Many cathedrals are often left unfinished. Sometimes they collapsed. Sometimes they couldn’t finish a spire. In the steeple of Notre Dame, there was a relic housed in the steeple. The Christians believed certain objects related to saints for example carried an aura of the divine and the holy. That would attract the pilgrims. Reflection on the building of St. Johns This cathedral is definitely not like the Parthenon. It is definitely for the community. It is to be used unlike the Parthenon which was for the Gods. But it is definitely different from the surroundings. These cathedrals were definitely much taller. These cathedrals were overlooking. It has a feeling that God is watching always. The entries to Notre Dame are huge. There are large buttresses at the front. The portrait of the city. These portraits were often abbreviated, meaning it missed certain parts. The building of the cathedral was partially possible due to the agrarian land around the city. url &lt;- &quot;https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/amiens_city.jpg&quot; It is actually a really light color when cleaned. Almost a marble-like white. It is not what we think about the “typical” url &lt;- &quot;https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/polychromy.jpg&quot; We should know the terms in red. The portals are the openings, with Trumeaus inbetween. The person to whom the cathedral was dedicated to would be “in trumeau”. Above the arcades (empty like windows) is the gallery of kings and there the Rose window which is in almost every cathedral. url &lt;- &quot;https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/cathedral_vocab.jpg&quot; All of the symbology of the cathedral is deeply interwoven. Most people around this time were illiterate. Maybe imagery was helpful. Maybe it was confusing url &lt;- &quot;https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/false_idols.jpg&quot; Are these false idols? Why is there so much false imagery? Is that not a commandment? Maybe think about this in terms of other religions. There are different relationships with idols and how to visually express the imagery of God. Iconoclasm: social belief in the importance of the destruction of icons and other images or monuments. This is an ongoing struggle between representation and overrepresentation becoming an idol. Are there clues to interpret? First the shape of the portal. Into the center of the cathedral, in the Trumeau, is Christ. In the proximity, is the disciples. The profits are further away, facing outward because they are literally relaying the word to the world. 4.1.1 The new models url &lt;- &quot;https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/the_ways_people are_showed.jpg&quot; There is a de-emphasizing of the body. Think about St. Augaustine. A self pity and not a focus on the body. They also appear stationary rather than moving. Remember the stained glass helps it feel immaterial. A flickering light everywhere. url &lt;- &quot;https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/front_of_amiens.jpg&quot; Average individuals would often go through different doors rather than the main portal. If Christ is the door, you are literally embraced by all of the followers. The shape too is incredible. It is almost a funnel. Eucharist is a reference to the last supper. Notice the one dark key stone. Symbol of the resurrected Christ, the spot where heaven and earth are conjoined. "],["st-john-the-divine.html", "Chapter 5 St. John the Divine 5.1 The exterior", " Chapter 5 St. John the Divine url &lt;- &quot;https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/st_john_di.jpg&quot; St. John the Divine depiction definition of Nave: The western half of the cathedral. Neogothic style Noticeably tall and lots of windows. Vertical lines on the columns. The “triforium” is dark If it was a pure gothic building, there would be a complete surrounding of this walkway known as the triforium. In this cathedral is goes around the back. This would not have been in a medieval cathedral. It is sometimes called the Bishop’s walk. It is probably 5 stories up from the ground floor. Even though people would not have seen this from the ground floor, there is still ornate decoration. Rounded roman arches are noticeable in the area. Often there were also scholars there as well. Religious institutions were often involved in scholarship and academia. There are no pews here. That is rather traditional to cathedrals (from medieval). More open space allows for more community involvement and people would typically stand. Cathedral was started in late 1800’s and finished in around 1940’s with some additional work later. Definition of Buttresses: A clever way to hold the wall in and allow massive amounts of stained glass. They are exterior supports that are pushing in. We notice the pointed arches and the hefty buttresses. On the inside are the ribbed vaults. These three allow for the height and space. Definition of Clerestory: Above the triforium. Level of windows on ground floor, then those on the triforium and then the clerestory. Stained glass windows: Intricate, even though they are so high up. Lots of colors. The natural light is transformed into so many different colors and give a unique, almost celestial feel. In this picture we have St. Matthew and St. Mark. Matthew was a tax collector. He has a coin purse and scroll. Second set, we have Hippocrates. Each pane. All are about the theme of medicine and healing. Each area has a theme, involving human endeavors over time. There are 6 or 7 different companies that worked on the stain glass so there is a lot of differences that you can notice. We have the triforium a while up and then the clerestory. Clerestory is about 8 stories and the top is about 12. Many cathedrals you can’t use the clerestory. But due to interior buttresses this cathedral can. Primarily the clerestory is used for additional light and include more stories. You can literally see the values of the church based on the images on the walls. 5.0.1 “Rosette level” – not an official term. Based on the rosette shape on the walls. It is also repeated in the window designs. Everything is interconnected throughout the cathedral. 5.0.2 Ribbed vault Allows more support. There is a larger, more open, and high feeling. The intersection of the arches is critical to this. Many of these pointed arches are thanks to Arabic architecture. The peak of the stories occurs on top. Mostly saints at clerestory level. On the rosette we have Jesus. A seated Jesus, with his arms out and doves (a symbol of the holy trinity). Also, with a halo around his head with 3 beams of light. 5.0.3 Decoration of the archways There are capitals at the top of the columns even though we are over 100 feet up. If it is a sacred space, then the top of the building needs to be just as nice as the pedestrian level. 5.0.4 Next level up: the attic We can see the top of the ceiling with a pitched roof. There is almost 60 feet of different between the roof and the ceiling. Problem of using guastavino tile instead of granite. The buttresses push in to counteract the weight of the ceiling and walls. However, the tiles were too light. The arch was beginning to buckle upwards. So, they had to make the ceiling heavier and they did so but putting blocks of cement on the top. 5.1 The exterior there are pretty much no gargoyles. There are a few but small ones. They are to keep birds away and shed water. Difference to Gothic Style: The Nave is much larger, 5 instead of 3. That is because the first half is built like a roman-esque style which is shorter but wider. The main differences is shared community use of the space and the artworks. For example, there are two Jewish menorahs on the high alter. The mission statement is that it is a prayer place for those of all to worship. It is episcopal rather than catholic.

We are in the Renaissance. In modern day Italy but of course back then it was not a united Italy. Florence and Rome were both independent. We now have Raphael, or Raffaello Sanzio de Urbino. We are now getting true biographies of the paintings. Previously, cathedrals and the Parthenon for example might have leading architects that we know a little bit about, but in gerenal there were hundreds to thousands of individual craftsmen. There is an amazing level of clarity to his paintings. One of the reasons he was so popular among people, including the pope. url &lt;- &quot;https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/self-portrait.jpg&quot; Our primary topics: - Human figure (currently we have Greek, medieval and now renaissance). - Background: now there is a foreground, middle ground and background. Previously, they were usually just portraits. - Space, - facial expressions, - composition and - representations of the divine. 6.1 Madonna del cardellino (Madonna of the Goldfinch) url &lt;- &quot;https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/first-r-picture.jpg&quot; We have virgin mary, gentle, looking at the babies in the picture. Which baby is more important? Likely to be Jesus. 6.1.1 Differences in the babies The clothed baby would be known as John the Baptist, which we can infer through iconography. How do we know that it is baby Jesus? He is fully illuminated. There is a European goldfinch in the hands. It represents the passion of Christ and his crucifixion (a small red dot on the bird). Notice there are little halos around all three of them (the one on Jesus is not really visible). The halo signifies sainthood. Previously, the halos literally merged the characters with the background. Often use gold background, which shows they are in heaven. (Revelations literally says the streets are of gold). The halos now are becoming a preference and not necessary. It often depends on who commissions the painting. There is also a protectiveness to Mary. There feet touch and he is literally between her legs being protected and here she is in the roll of the mother. There are plants growing at jesus’ feet which was carefully planned. We are in a Earthly sphere. We are somewhere that we feel is normal. This is accessible to us. 6.1.2 Posture We also can tell it is Jesus by his posture. Even though it is a baby, it is positioned specifically. It is on one foot, broad and full front rather than from the side. The classical figures from the Greeks, you will always have this sense of frontality. There is also a continuity between the two. Mary is holding a bible too; which Jesus is in close proximity to. Contrapposto is the key pose of the image. It is the key pos of classical Greece. This canonical pose is reserved historically for very important people. Augustus is in contrapposto for example. He is seen as divine through the Roman gods. What were the values in art for the classical Greeks? Why are they nude? Most argue that it is going back to naturalism. Think Genesis or even the Greeks. It is also about showing the accurate anatomy in some sense. 6.1.3 Composition Composition of the piece. The Greeks wanted you to arrive at a sense of harmony and working in the music. What is going on here? There is also a line of sight, starting with Jesus, line of his arm going to John and then going to Mary through her arm with a halo of clouds. There is also a visual continuity between them. There is also a noticeable triangle in the center of the picture. This is a classical positional technique of the renaissance. The triangle represents the holy trinity, but it is also really well balanced. There is also a sense of atmosphereic perspective. With more focus on the foreground and less on the background, the background begins to mute and colors become more dull. 6.1.4 Alba Madonna: url &lt;- &quot;https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/alba-madonna.jpg&quot; Here, Mary is teaching and mediating Jesus to us. She hold him up. In the midlevel picture, he looks like a miniature adult. He is presented as the savior. It is a divine aspect of Jesus rather than childhood. Mary is not in the motherly moment. She is presenting him, but as an important figure rather than anything else. Why is there a shift towards having backgrounds? Some of this is humanism. They are focused on the figures as humans, just like us. The paintings feel realistic. Red and blue will almost always mean Mary. Blue for heavens, red for blood of Christ. Blue was also an incredibly expensive color. Definition of Tondo format: This means round painting. The background in this feels less involved. The background feels less muted. url &lt;- &quot;https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/midevil_style.jpg&quot; St. Luke was the first portrayer. The surviving portraits were all the style above so in order to keep the proximity to the heavenly, they used the same holding style for example. 6.2 Sistine Madonna url &lt;- &quot;https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/raf-for-pope.jpg&quot; There is an incredible interaction here. She is in contrapposto but also gazing at the viewing. It feels engaging, almost like she is coming down to be with you. There is the pope’s hat at the left. The pope is in the painting on the left. He is gesturing outside of the realm. He is showing what is behind the curtain. He is helping us see what is behind the curtain. His hand pointing is shown as “foreshortening”. It seems real and is piercing the canvas into our space. The angels on the edge feel almost on our sphere. They feel like genuine human kids in some sense. Raphael merges the physical, our space, with the space in the image. 6.3 Human Body There is a great emphasis placed on accuracy of the human body. The 1500’s provided great insight into the human body. The architecture of the time goes bby the same principles. Perfect proportionality and clarity are incredibly important for this time. There is an exagerated quest for balance and harmony that is immedietly perceptable to you. 6.4 St. Peters url &lt;- &quot;https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/st_peters.JPG&quot; Basilica church is a longitudinal church. It has a really long length. This is the basilica of St. Peter. url &lt;- &quot;https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/st_peter_blue.JPG&quot; We see other proposals as well. The plans on the right are very centralized. The papal states under this pope become quite powerful. They expand their power and Pope Julius II uses the money to beautify the Vatican and surrounding area. There is a massive building. 6.5 Raphael in the interior rooms: Stanza della Segnatura Everywhere is painted including the ceiling. This is the room of the signature. It is based in philosophy. url &lt;- &quot;https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Raffael_Stanza_della_Segnatura.jpg&quot; 6.5.1 School of Athens url &lt;- &quot;https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/The_School_of_Athens.jpg&quot; 6.5.2 Composition Raphael used various colors, groups of people and placements to show harmony and and unity. Even the statues are of different genders and versions. What are the organizational principles about the crowd of people. There seems to be maybe two “tiers” of people. There are philosophers everywhere. This is a reanimiation of the creative minds of classical antiquity. The renaissance was the rebirth of this. The left and right seems to be different as well on the bottom level. The right seem to be observing the left is making fundamentals like math. 6.5.3 Where is Rafael? Rafael is in the lower right, barely visable. Interestingly next to zoroastra and talame. What does that mean? Maybe it is because he is observing and painting things as they are. We have euclid with a compass and he is necessary, Rafael thinks to good art. That is the domain for which Rafael can make these beautiful realistic paintings. Art was seen as very mechanical at this time. 6.5.4 Plato and Aristotle Plato is pointing up. Plato’s gesture toward the sky is thought to indicate his Theory of Forms. This philosophy argues that the “real” world is not the physical one, but instead a spiritual realm of ideas filled with abstract concepts and ideas. The physical realm, for Plato, is merely the material, imperfect things we see and interact with on a daily basis. Aristotle’s hand is a visual representation of his belief that knowledge comes from experience. Empiricism, as it is known, theorizes that humans must have concrete evidence to support their ideas and is very much grounded in the physical world. 6.6 Principles of organization In a sense, there is a wonderful combination of chaos and complete organization. There is so much it may feel overwhelming but the more you look at it, the more you see the beauty and organization. This is from a time period known as the “high-Renaissance”. 6.6.1 Composition Would there be lines in this painting. How would you draw them to make a vanishing point? There are two teirs in the photo. There is the bottom right, bottom left, top right, top left and center. Each group represents a different group of philosophers. The vanishing point it much further back at the clouds. Where is the focal point? 6.6.1.1 Vanishing point The painters understood they would use this as the focal point. Maybe they made the figure of Jesus the focal point and the vanishing point was married with this. It is interesting that in this picture, it is somewhat in between. The focal point is sort of in between Aristotle and Plato. They represent schools of thought and this shows that there is not one individual point of focus but requires many individuals to contribute. At the time, there is also a neo-platonism where the ideals of Christianity and philosophy are mixing and Plato is seen almost as a proto-Christian. There was even an academy in Florence of Platos thought at the time. It was flourishing at the time. 6.6.1.2 Spaces There are many archways that go back and back. There is this massive open space in a picture which is truly amazing. The architecture is the basilica of St. Peters which is being built. 6.6.2 The center figure (below)! The man in the center, leaning on the marble block is rather strange. He is one of the most striking and doesn’t seem to fit in. The marble block seems to point away and is crooked. Interestingly, he was not in the preparatory drawing. His sculpted knee gives us a feeling that he should represent Michelangelo and saying the figure is Michelangelo-esque. Even though the actual philosophical ideal is Heraclitus. Michelangelo is literally working next door at the time! However it appears Rafael didn’t paint him in a great light. He is in an annoying spot, feels out of place and is an old man. However, in another sense he is also paying homage. He is on the platonic side of thought. It is divine inspiration maybe. Not completely focused on dimensions, but on conveying the point of thought. Rafael was loved by many at the time for producing his works by the books. We can thank biographies written at the time to our understanding.

It is in your face and bold and black. This portraits seems almost nervous and timid. There is a pyschological air to this. How does the author see themselves. The background is interestingly lit up as well. It seems youthful. This background is somewhat new to us. Rather rough and somewhat abstract. His hair seems quite course. It seems almost tactile. The hair almost feels like we can touch it. The presence is very different in the picture. He used the back of the brush which is very interesting. How is paint used to render hair between the two? Rembrandt’s hair feels more real. Durer relies more heavily on the different colores for contrast. Rembrandts feel more like laying and the form. 10.1.0.1 Older Portrait old_rem_url &lt;- &quot;https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/rembrandt-older-portrait.jpg&quot; Older Self Portrait This one is much later, at 1660. He was more experienced by now. The contemporaries didn’t love the loose brush stroke that he was known for. Most people wanted realistic close brush strokes. They would say his works are unfinished, more like a sketch. There is so much skin texture. It is more wrinkly and smooth at the same time. There is quite a lot of detail while also being super unrealistic. At a close level, it doesn’t look normal, but it looks almost how it feels. It almost look leathery. It is somewhat, what it feels like. It also makes him less contoured, he begins to blend into the back ground. Imagine this hanging back in the 1600’s, with just a little bit of candlelight and not the spotlights that we have today. 10.1.0.1.1 The coat: The coat is really interesting. The splashes of various colors, reds and greens is very interesting. Not the fur coat that we saw earlier. Much longer strokes. The paint behaves almost like it has tension. Because the brush went in all different directions, it feels almost on the body. The coat feels worn and old, maybe slightly faded. It is ironically shown with more colors. You can see the seems in the shoulders, and it is almost falling apart. 10.1.0.1.2 Is this a self-portrait the_artist_in &lt;- &quot;https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Rembrandt_The_Artist_in_his_studio.jpg&quot; Rembrandt, The Artist in his studio The room is really worn. Around it, there are items for painting. A palette, and materials to mix his paint. Maybe the question is what is art to Rembrandt. All the tools are in the room, but the viewer has to imagine what is on the painting. All you truly need is your imagination. 10.1.0.2 Similar presentation of a man with a golden helmet man_helmet &lt;- &quot;https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Rembrandt_The_Man_with_the_Golden_Helmet.jpg&quot; Rembrandt, The Man with the Golden Helmet (ca. 1650) There is a such a feeling of life here. He sits here, and you can almost feel the weight of all he has been through. All of Rembrandt’s pictures portraits sort of look like they need a hug. Definitely not the most cheerful. "]]
