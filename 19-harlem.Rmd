# Harlem Renaissance

The Harlem Renaissance was an intellectual and cultural revival of African American music, dance, art, fashion, literature, theater and politics centered in Harlem, Manhattan, New York City, spanning the 1920s and 1930s. At the time, it was known as the "New Negro Movement." The Harlem Renaissance is considered to have been a rebirth of the African-American arts. Black culture shifted from rural to urban and peasant to sophisticated.

Five overlapping masks from different African tribes convey a mysterious spiritual dimension summoned by ritual dance [![Les Fétiches](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/las_fetiches_mailou_jones.jfif "Les Fétiches")](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/las_fetiches_mailou_jones.jfif) We can compare that to a similar mask painted by Picasso:

## Romare Bearden

African-American artist, author, and songwriter who grew up in New York City and was influential with the Harlem Renaissance. He is also a modernist that worked with collage. Picasso used collage to deconstruct western ideals, whereas Bearden takes it in a new direction.

> "I use many disparate elements to form a picture, or part of a background. I rarely use an actual photograph of a face but build them, for example, from parts of African masks, animals eyes, marbles, corn and mossy vegetation. In such a process, often something specific and particular can have its meaning extended toward what is more general and universal but never at the expense of the total structure." ("Rectangular Structure in My Montage Paintings" [1969/77]:17

Dove might have this sort of religious significance. A birds eye view with a religious symbol.
