[![](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/example_monet_paintings.JPG "Example paintings")](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/example_monet_paintings.JPG)

Famous French painter and considered the first modernist artist.

## Modern Art

Style and ideology of art produced during roughly from the 1860's through 1970s.

-   Rejection of history and conservative values
-   Innovation and experimentation with form with a tendency to abstraction
-   an emphasis on materials, techniques, and processes

### The academy

The great art was already known. It was classical or neoclassical. Idealized beauty and very specific motifs. You were not supposed to innovate. They received the official stamp of the government.

## Olympia

First exhibited at the 1865 Paris Salon, which shows a nude woman ("Olympia") lying on a bed being brought flowers by a servant. Incredibly controversial at the time!

The brush strokes are thick and rough. The body is not completely idealized. Monet is said to have said "I paint what I see, not what people want to see." the orchid in her hair, her bracelet, pearl earrings and the oriental shawl on which she lies, symbols of wealth and sensuality show that she is a prostitute or "demi-mondaine."

### Comparison to Venus of Urbino (1538)

Olympia's confrontational gaze caused shock and astonishment when the painting was first exhibited because a number of details in the picture identified her as a prostitute.

#### Gaze in Olympia

Her gaze is rather unique as well. It is almost off center. She doesn't look dreamy or elegant. There is a weird tilt to her head compared to usual. Unlike the usual hair, the hair is tight and not very noticeable. It was scandalous for her face to look directly at the viewer. It was customary to look down or to the side.

#### The Hand

Flexed versus curved and relaxed. Her hand in Olympia is rigid to show how a prostitute must prevent or allow access to her body based on payment.

#### The Animals

The cat is there to symbolize prostitution or nocturnal promiscuity whereas the dog is considered more noble.

### The Maid:

Originally overlooked, but now really common in discussion. It is still debated on the intention of Monet towards showing the black maid. This might not have necessarily subverted the social norms. Slavery was just recently outlawed but stereotypes persisted.

She is likely a paid brothel maid. She is not portrayed as a sex object as was sometimes common. She is not incredibly dignified but also not a caricature. The dark background also makes her more hidden. She almost feels hidden. She is very covered, and presented with a very large outfit, especially compared to the nude women next to her.

He actually lived in a realtively black neighborhood.

She is also included in two additional works!

#### The more academy sanctioned approach

[![Promenade Des Enfants by Timoéon Marie Lobrichon](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/promenade-des-enfants-timoleon-marie-lobrichon.jpg "Promenade Des Enfants by Timoéon Marie Lobrichon")](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/promenade-des-enfants-timoleon-marie-lobrichon.jpg)

Here we have pastels, realistic heights, paved plazas and focus on white nannies.

Leisure time is a new phenomenon at the time. The original, the Tuileries garden was a place to stroll around. The bourgeois viewers would likely prefer the perfect looking outfits and costumes. Meanwhile, the black nannies had a different outfit. More thought provoking in the view. You don't feel at ease. Forboding trees, less order and the black nanny would be more anxiety provoking at the time.

##### The Gentleman:

There is a gentlemen in the back left on both paintings. In Monet, it almost appears like he is a vagrant or homeless and people need to stay away. Meanwhile on the Lobrichon, the male viewer seems to be keeping watch and protecting the group.

### Modern Comparison to Olympia

This is a more post modern, reaction and critique of modernism. It literally frames her and has layered criticism about the genre and painting.

The assertion of Olympia's sexuality continues to live on and take on various approaches.

## Photography (ethnographic)

Photography does a lot more than the salon-sanctioned paintings for minorities including blacks. It doesn't always have the best intentions however.
