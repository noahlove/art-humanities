The best pictures would be displayed in the "Salon." It was deeply connected to the academy. This is interconnected to the academy awards and similar rankings.

Questions to be asking when interpreting:

-   How are emotions shown in individuals

-   How are genders constructed here

-   How are people grouped

-   How is this painting historical and how is this a "history painting"

-   What makes this a neo-classical painting?

#### Neoclassical style

This is representing classical sculpture and ideal. We are in the 18th century, but still have a since of classicism. We have Roman soldiers with their distinctive helmets. Louis the 16th was reigning and saw himself as inheriting this tradition.

The women are noticably sitting and not focused on the action in the center. This is highlighted by the light. The arms and man in the center have a sort of spotlight. The Woman even have a virgen Mary type positioning.

There is an interesting framing using the colonnade. The 3 groups of subjects are framed by the arches (Roman).

#### What were the ideals of enlightenment?

The goal is to pull back the values here: have it feel like the original periods of Greeks and Romans. The enlightenment thoughts and philosophies: what did they mean to the average person? What was the goal of the average person? Just to use reasoning?

In a sense, there was a goal to pursue truth inherently. To be happy is to use your pursuit of reason and become moral through that path.
