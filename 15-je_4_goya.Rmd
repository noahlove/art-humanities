The 1658 self portrait of Rembrandt presents as a wealthy, noble maybe even military like older gentleman to the viewer. At 52 years old, Rembrandt appears slightly tired, but also distinguished.

His attire appears to be that of a wealthy individual; he has a large fur robe over him which is painted with a mixture of blotchy spots and long smooth patches. Similar to the way a bear fur looks in person. His more central attire, is a very different type of painting, it is really long streaky lines. It reminds me almost of horse hair. However, this garb loses its texture the further up it goes. Around his neck, the gold turns into a mixture of disoriented white, black and gold specs. It is a mixture of dots, light brush streaks and splotches.Â  His red belt-like piece is similar but with much less defined strokes, but still a defined stroke direction. Reminiscent of how I would imagine a silk product would be painted. The overall outfit is really interesting: it doesn't seem similar to the typical artist we have seen like the earlier Rembrandt. He is flourishing and unsparing in his depiction of his attire. He seems to present himself as the king of artists.

Even though he is in this extravagant outfit, you still see the wear in his face. This face reminds me of the similarly older painting we saw in class: blotchy, probably many layers of paint on top of each other. However, even though the paint is so blotchy, his face seems so realistic. Features that stuck out to me were especially how you could so clearly see the double chin as well as his clearly defined nostril and bags below his eyes. Even the touch of rosy cheeks is so clear to see, even though there doesn't feel to be a particular smoothness. The point that seems to be the most smooth is actually his eyes: smooth dark blue with specs of white.

This textured approach to skin is continued into his right hand which lay on top of the arm of the chair. It feels wrinkled or old, but at the same time carries a high level of detail. You can easily depict his thumb nail and knuckles. It even seems like there is a feeling of a vein running through his hand. His other hand, the left however, is substantially different. This hand feels much more abstracted. The brush strokes appear similar to his garb, but with more differentiated lines in the stroke. The knuckles are no longer clear, only the location where they should be based on the changing in direction of a new stroke.

Even the background is blotted with a different texture rather than just a constant color. It reminds me of school picture backgrounds with their slightly textured feel which helps provide contrast between Rembrandt and the dark black that surrounds him. However, it seems clear he didn't want a large amount of contrast or to seem too distant from this encroaching darkness. His black hat seems reminiscent of to the halos we saw earlier in class: this time his surrounded not by a heavenly aura but a darkness that seems to weigh deeply on his face.

Because of the more finite painting style of Ruts, he feels much more tangible to us. Although in both paintings, it is clear that they are wearing fur robes, Ruts' feels substantially more tactile, almost like I can feel the furs myself. The white ruffles feel the same way: both soft and also incredibly stiff.

### **Nicolaes Ruts**

Comparatively, the portrait of Nicolaes Ruts feels much more photo-realistic. Although there are strokes that you can see (purposefully) in the fur, beard and very edges of his hat, everything else is completely blended and you can no longer see individual strokes. For example, Ruts' face feels incredibly smooth in the bottom of the cheeks as a results of only seeing a color and with no blotches of paint. Because of this, imperfections in the skin are more clear, little small blemishes in the color feel like freckles and the developing of wrinkles on his face.

His mustache and parts of his beard take on an incredibly similar feel to the younger self-portrait by Rembrandt. A strong blending of colors form a smooth base, on top of which very clear lines are drawn on top on a very noticeable color. They definitely draw your attention in towards the subject. It also feels to me as though it makes his face seem larger and more prominent than it would have with just simplistic painting like the fur robe.

Of final note, his positioning is very interesting, almost indecisive to me. He appears positioned sideways in a chair, with his right hand apparently assisting him in raising up. His right hand, painted in very clear detail, shows a note of which we can't make out. Although likely designed to show his position in some court, to me it almost feels like he was surprised by some unsettling news. He is now raising up to talk with us, whom he looks at, about this important piece of paper.

Overall, both are portraits of somewhat elderly men of power and importance in society, and yet both portray that artistically in very different ways. In the difference in detailing, through a realistic or blotchy approach, there seems to be a different sense in connecting with each subject. Ruts seems person-like; his portrait is to show you, the viewer, what he looked like and that he was an important person. Rembrandt's self-portrait seems much more complex: he sits, puzzled, surrounded by darkness. The portrait almost feels blurred by the blotchy painting style, and yet still detailed, making us think more deeply about the subject's problems. This portrait feels more engaging, mysterious and intriguing.

## Goya

![Goya's The Forge](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/goya_the_forge.jpg "Goya the forge")

The work presents immediately as scene taken out of time and context and placed in a gray room. The palette is dark, similar to many other of Goya's later works. It shows 3 hardworking individuals. It is very masculine; clearly defined muscles in the legs and arms and postures that show this is a habitual activity. Based on the title and characteristic orange glow, these men are forging some type of object although it is hard to say what.

These scene to me would represent a prequel to the "Disasters of War Collection" that we viewed in class, possibly weapons for the upcoming war. In a sense, they are also unaware of the effects their individual contribution has to the larger economy and society. Just like the background in the painting, they don't understand the full picture of what is going on. In a similar sense, the reality of the workers ruins the serenity of an otherwise calm background. It is as though the poor working conditions experienced by the working class disrupts the otherwise tranquil culture of a society.

I imagine this representing the plight of the average man: slaving away at an individual task, often using brute force to make a living. For the three men, it seems to represent quite literally, back breaking work. This is noticeable for the man in the back right who appears to be much older than the other two. For the average man then, there was no retirement necessarily, work until you can't and then hope that your family takes care of you. It seems to criticize the working conditions of Europe, especially Spain at the time.
