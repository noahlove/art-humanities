# Goya

Goya's life spanned the Enlightenment, Neoclassicism and the French revolution, including the Napoleonic wars and the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy. The works we will look at below were creatd in Madrid or near Madrid Spain. He is often considered the last traditional and classical painter and the first we see modern painter we have. We will have to take a look at Goya's modernity. 

At the time Spain was behind other european countries in terms of development. The paintings also refer to the inquisition: the radical reassertion of catholic hegemony. Anything supposed to be heretical or opposed to true religion was persecuted, such as Judaism in Spain.
