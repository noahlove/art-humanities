*definition of Nave*: The western half of the cathedral. Neogothic style 

Noticeably tall and lots of windows. Vertical lines on the columns. The “triforium” is dark 

If it was a pure gothic building, there would be a complete surrounding of this walkway known as the triforium. In this cathedral is goes around the back. This would not have been in a medieval cathedral. It is sometimes called the Bishop’s walk. It is probably 5 stories up from the ground floor. Even though people would not have seen this from the ground floor, there is still ornate decoration. 

Rounded roman arches are noticeable in the area.  

Often there were also scholars there as well. Religious institutions were often involved in scholarship and academia. There are no pews here. That is rather traditional to cathedrals (from medieval). More open space allows for more community involvement and people would typically stand.  

Cathedral was started in late 1800’s and finished in around 1940’s with some additional work later.  

*Definition of Buttresses*: A clever way to hold the wall in and allow massive amounts of stained glass. They are exterior supports that are pushing in. We notice the pointed arches and the hefty buttresses. On the inside are the ribbed vaults. These three allow for the height and space.  


*Definition of Clerestory*: Above the triforium. Level of windows on ground floor, then those on the triforium and then the clerestory.  


Stained glass windows: Intricate, even though they are so high up. Lots of colors. The natural light is transformed into so many different colors and give a unique, almost celestial feel. In this picture we have St. Matthew and St. Mark.  

Matthew was a tax collector. He has a coin purse and scroll.  

Second set, we have Hippocrates. Each pane. All are about the theme of medicine and healing. Each area has a theme, involving human endeavors over time. There are 6 or 7 different companies that worked on the stain glass so there is a lot of differences that you can notice. We have the triforium a while up and then the clerestory. Clerestory is about 8 stories and the top is about 12.  Many cathedrals you can’t use the clerestory. But due to interior buttresses this cathedral can. Primarily the clerestory is used for additional light and include more stories. You can literally see the values of the church based on the images on the walls.  

### “Rosette level” – not an official term. 
Based on the rosette shape on the walls. It is also repeated in the window designs. Everything is interconnected throughout the cathedral.  

### Ribbed vault
 Allows more support. There is a larger, more open, and high feeling. The intersection of the arches is critical to this. Many of these pointed arches are thanks to Arabic architecture. The peak of the stories occurs on top. Mostly saints at clerestory level. On the rosette we have Jesus. A seated Jesus, with his arms out and doves (a symbol of the holy trinity). Also, with a halo around his head with 3 beams of light.  

### Decoration of the archways
 There are capitals at the top of the columns even though we are over 100 feet up. If it is a sacred space, then the top of the building needs to be just as nice as the pedestrian level.  

### Next level up: the attic
We can see the top of the ceiling with a pitched roof. There is almost 60 feet of different between the roof and the ceiling.  

Problem of using guastavino tile instead of granite. The buttresses push in to counteract the weight of the ceiling and walls. However, the tiles were too light. The arch was beginning to buckle upwards. So, they had to make the ceiling heavier and they did so but putting blocks of cement on the top.  

## The exterior
there are pretty much no gargoyles. There are a few but small ones. They are to keep birds away and shed water.  

Difference to Gothic Style: The Nave is much larger, 5 instead of 3. That is because the first half is built like a roman-esque style which is shorter but wider. The main differences is shared community use of the space and the artworks. For example, there are two Jewish menorahs on the high alter.  

The mission statement is that it is a prayer place for those of all to worship. It is episcopal rather than catholic.
