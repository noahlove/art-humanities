### Oath of Horatii or Le Serment des Horaces

[![Jaques-Louis David](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Le_Serment_des_Horaces.jpg "Le Serment des Horaces")](http://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Le_Serment_des_Horaces.jpg)

The best pictures would be displayed in the "Salon." It was deeply connected to the academy. This is interconnected to the academy awards and similar rankings.

Questions to be asking when interpreting:

-   How are emotions shown in individuals

-   How are genders constructed here

-   How are people grouped

-   How is this painting historical and how is this a "history painting"

-   What makes this a neo-classical painting?

#### Neoclassical style

This is representing classical sculpture and ideal. We are in the 18th century, but still have a since of classicism. We have Roman soldiers with their distinctive helmets. Louis the 16th was reigning and saw himself as inheriting this tradition.

The women are noticably sitting and not focused on the action in the center. This is highlighted by the light. The arms and man in the center have a sort of spotlight. The Woman even have a virgin Mary type positioning.

There is an interesting framing using the colonnade. The 3 groups of subjects are framed by the arches (Roman).

#### What were the ideals of enlightenment?

The goal is to pull back the values here: have it feel like the original periods of Greeks and Romans. The enlightenment thoughts and philosophies: what did they mean to the average person? What was the goal of the average person? Just to use reasoning?

In a sense, there was a goal to pursue truth inherently. To be happy is to use your pursuit of reason and become moral through that path. Similarly: neoclassicism brings in stories that inform your moral sense. The example of loyalty here would be an example of a value that is suppose to educate people.

There feels to be a civic duty here.

#### History

This picture depicts an event where 3 members of each side of a battle would be elected to decide a battle. This was a ritual duel and shows a father and 3 sons. The 3 brothers are clearly showing loyalty and solidarity with Rome. The mother and sisters are shown sad and their brightness often brings your eye to the right.

If you look at the gestures: Socrates in the middle is rather interesting. Similar to Plato in School of Athens, pointing towards the sky and the world of the forms. The people around him are so sad to see him die, they are his students and friends.

It is believed that Plato is sitting at the end of his bed, a memory of him.

## Angelica Kauffman

Swiss born artist. She is known for her very subtle critics of the institution at her time, especially as one of only two females part of the Royal Academy.

A female artist wearing working clothes intently studies a classical cast. She is an allegorical figure, meaning she represents an idea; in this case, 'design', or 'drawing', as one of the four elements of art.

Here is a good depiction by Johan Joseph Zoffany of the Royal Academy. Mainly all mails except for the two females. Males could use real models, but females couldn't. Females would only be able to use figures.

### Zeuxis Selecting Models for His Painting of Helen of Troy

[![Zeuxis Selecting Models for His Painting of Helen of Troy](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Zeuxis_Selecting_Models_for_His_Painting_of_Helen_of_Troy.jpg)](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Zeuxis_Selecting_Models_for_His_Painting_of_Helen_of_Troy.jpg)

The female on the left is noticeably different. She is standing in front of the canvas, with maybe a paintbrush. She is actually about to paint.

### The mysterious female on the right

This is a very interesting depiction of sexes. The one male (second from the right, Zeuxis), somewhat reverses the neoclassical tradition. There is not a focus on the female body. Zeuxis is a 5th century painter. There is also female nudity, although this was not necessarily rare. The female on the far right however, is clearly breaking a typically norm that was perceived. She steps behind the artist and picks up his brush and looks like she will begin to paint. It is kind of a daring moment. The female had the role of the passive model, while the male had the active role. The females are typically passive and the object, however here: she becomes active. It is quite possible that it is Kauffman, and in fact here signature is right next to the painter.

There is a very neoclassical statement when choosing the topic. The classic artists were focused on perfection, Zeuxis tried to combine the best features of all the women to make the perfect Helen of Troy.

She is literally claiming the male space. She is claiming the area as hers. At the same time, she appears to be one of the models but also asserting herself as a contemporary painter.

### Going against objectifying women?

The nude women don't necessarily appear super realistic. Unlike the classical style. The women in the center takes on the contra-posto positioning typical of important individuals in classical paintings.

Kauffman is one of 2 women in the male institution. If she is going to make a statement it still needs to be subtle. It is a almost a subversive act.

There is also a clear progression of women. The female in the center is clearly being turned by the man. However, as you progress to the right, the women become more active.

> By identifying too closely with the male artist and his creative potential, she ran the risk of denying what was perhaps her most important attribute, her gender, and therefore opening herself to attack for being sexually transgressive. But identification with the passive female model would seem to deny the woman artist her status as agent. It is the apparent impossibility of escaping this impasse that makes Kauffman's painting so remarkable.

As a late 18th century painting, there are other contemporary aspects to take into affect including race. Slavery is being ended in Great Britain. In the language of otherness, it was often black people. However, there is also a construction of whiteness. There is a kind of reasserting through paintings like this a notion of self-hood and nation-hood.

## Why are History Paintings So Important

Alberti had a theory called "historia." There is a story from ancient times. He explains the theory of the accumulation of people, animals, and buildings, which create harmony amongst each other, and "hold the eye of the learned and unlearned spectator for a long while with a certain sense of pleasure and emotion". There needs to be a lot occurring that is meaningful and important in meaning.

##### David Patrocle

Similarly, the painting of Zeuxis is similar. How can they paint a historical painting but also add their own unique critique or interpretation.
