# Pablo Picasso

Pablo Picasso's full name is actually really large and includes various saints and relatives. His birth certificate is: Pablo Diego José Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno Cipriano de la Santísima Trinidad Ruiz Picasso.

Picasso made this self-portrait at age twenty-five. In preparatory drawings he placed a brush in his right hand, but he chose not to include it here. Its absence is notable; it may be Picasso sending a message to viewers of art: creativity is not merely a manual skill but an inner vision.

The ovoid head, staring eyes, and long ears are elements Picasso borrowed from an ancient sculpture. In this painting he responds to the carved head's enigmatic, masklike expression. And since it came from an archaeological site not far from Málaga, his birthplace, it also connects to Picasso's own sense of Spanishness.

## Paul Cézanne

French artist and [Post-Impressionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Impressionist "Post-Impressionist") painter whose work laid the foundations of the transition from the 19th-century conception of artistic endeavor to a new and radically different world of art in the 20th century.

Cézanne is said to have formed the bridge between late 19th-century [Impressionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism "Impressionism") and the early 20th century's new line of artistic enquiry, [Cubism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubism "Cubism"). Cézanne's often repetitive, exploratory brushstrokes are highly characteristic and clearly recognizable. He used planes of colour and small brushstrokes that build up to form complex fields. The paintings convey Cézanne's intense study of his subjects. Both [Matisse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Matisse "Henri Matisse") and [Picasso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso "Pablo Picasso") are said to have remarked that Cézanne "is the father of us all".

Here is an example of Cézanne´s gradual transition, painting the same scene over his lifetime.

## Complete Cubism

[![The Reservoir, Horta de Ebro](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/the_reservoir_Horta_de_Ebro_Picasso.jpg "The Reservoir, Horta de Ebro")](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/the_reservoir_Horta_de_Ebro_Picasso.jpg)

This landscape was among several Picasso produced in southern Spain in 1909 that were critical to the development of the early Cubist style. Depicting the town of Horta de Sant Joan, *The Reservoir, Horta de Ebro* is composed of simplified geometric shapes. Picasso used interlocking planes to fuse the background's rugged topography with the terra-cotta and stucco architecture of the village in the foreground. The composition exemplifies the spatial ambiguity characteristic of Cubism: the steep hillside seems to be seen from below, while the curved shape at the bottom---a cistern---provides a downward view into a reflective pool of water.

Here Picasso has turned this view of a group of houses perched at the top of a hill into an agglomeration of geometrical forms, with all detailing such as windows, removed. The topography of the scene has also been freely rearranged to emphasize further that this landscape has been produced from many distinct viewpoints.

### Les Demoiselles d'Avignon

[![Les Demoiselles d'Avignon](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Les_Demoiselles_d'Avignon.jpg "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon")](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Les_Demoiselles_d'Avignon.jpg)

They are staring at you, meaning you are the patron, the client of a brothel. In a sense, you are directly on top of them, as they are laying on the bed. It is a sexualized mode of viewing.

In an earlier sketch of "Les Demoiselles," the figure to the left was a male medical student, skull in hand, entering the brothel, but the artist decided that such a customer added an element of narrative that would detract from the overall impact of the scene.

## Henri Matisse

Along with [Picasso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picasso "Picasso")'s [*Les Demoiselles d'Avignon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Demoiselles_d%27Avignon "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon"), *Le bonheur de vivre* is regarded as one of the pillars of early [modernism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism "Modernism").

[![Le bonheur de vivre](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Bonheur_Matisse.jpg "Le bonheur de vivre")](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Bonheur_Matisse.jpg)

The monumental canvas was first exhibited at the [Salon des Indépendants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_des_Ind%C3%A9pendants "Salon des Indépendants") of 1906, where its cadmium colors and spatial distortions caused a public expression of protest and outrage. It is called "Bonheur de Vivre" or the Joy of Life. It is a psychedelic orgy-like crazy scene.

## Diego Valázques

Las meninas is a court painting from 1656.

[![Las Meninas](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Las_Meninas_small.jpg "Las Meninas")](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/Las_Meninas_small.jpg)

It gives a feeling that you are the King/Queen, that just walked in the room. The painting shows the dynamics of power.

## Cubism of Picasso

[![Ma Jolie](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/ma_jolie.jpg "Ma Jolie")](https://s3.trueloveserver.com/arthum/ma_jolie.jpg)

"I love her very much and I will write this in my paintings," Picasso, referring to his lover Marcelle Humbert, revealed in a letter. By inscribing "MA JOLIE" (my pretty one) on the bottom of this painting, the first of at least twelve works on which he did so, he privately referenced his nickname for Humbert while publicly alluding to the refrain of a popular music-hall song. These highly legible words, along with the nearby treble clef and musical staff, form a striking contrast to the near-indecipherable image of a figure that disappears into a network of flickering, semitransparent planes.
